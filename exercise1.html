	<p style="text-align:left"> A man had the coolest reaction to winning a whopping figure on the Australian version of TV quiz show The 1% Club.</p>

	<p>	Joe recently took part in the game show hosted by comedian Jim Jefferies, getting to the most nerve-racking moment of the show: the feared final question. </p>

	<p>	Asked whether he wanted to give a try to answer the last question, he and his opponent Catherine decided to continue their race for a chance to win a very tempting cash prize.</p>

	<p>	The two gamers were up against each other to win $96,000, but they both risked going home empty-handed if neither of them had answered correctly.</p>
